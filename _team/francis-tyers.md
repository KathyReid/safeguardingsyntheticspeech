Tyers is an expert in computational morphology and syntax including finite-state and neural-network approaches to modelling and management of annotation projects and has developed syntactically annotated corpora for over 14 languages, including two Mesoamerican languages: Western Sierra Puebla Nahuatl and K'iche'.

Tyers has extensive experience in creating finite-state models that capture linguistic and orthographic variation gained by years of experience in working with languages exhibiting wide variation. He has additional expertise in lexicon-driven machine translation and knowledge extraction for creating translation dictionaries.
